This experiment is all about making web pages feel alive. Instead of static lists,
 you’ll build a product interface that responds instantly to user input no page reloads, no waiting. 
 Just smooth, real-time filtering using JavaScript and the DOM.
By selecting a category from a dropdown menu, users can instantly see only the products that match their choice. 
It’s a simple but powerful way to learn how JavaScript can control what users see and how they interact with your site.

LEARNING OUTCOMES :
- DOM manipulation: Dynamically show or hide elements based on user actions.
- Event handling: Use the change event to trigger updates when the dropdown value changes.
- Data attributes: Organize and filter items using custom data-category tags.
- Real time UI Updates: create a seamless user experience without reloading the page.
- Clean code structure: separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for maintainability.
