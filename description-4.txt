Let’s make typing a bit more interesting! In this activity, 
i will create a simple webpage where the number of characters they type shows up instantly. 
As they type into a box, the counter updates in real time like a little helper keeping track.
It’s a fun way to learn how websites react to what users do, and it’s super easy to build with just a few lines of code. 
Plus, it’s a great intro to how JavaScript handles user actions and updates the page without needing to reload.

- Watching what you type
You’ll use JavaScript to notice every letter typed and respond right away.
- Showing the count instantly
As you type, the number of characters updates live—no waiting, no clicking.
- Why it’s useful
Lots of websites use this to help people stay within limits, like tweets or form messages.
- Easy to build
Just basic HTML, a little CSS for style, and simple JavaScript to make it work.
